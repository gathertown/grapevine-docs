description: Setup Claude Code integration with Grapevine
---

This guide shows how to configure Claude Code to use Grapevine for company context.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed
- A Grapevine tenant

## Setup with OAuth (Recommended)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the MCP server">
  Run the following command to add the Grapevine MCP server:

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport http grapevine https://mcp.getgrapevine.ai
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Launch `claude`, and run `/mcp`. Navigate to the `grapevine` server then "Authenticate"
  Your browser will open to authenticate you with Grapevine. Make sure to login using the same account you use to access your [Grapevine dashboard](https://app.getgrapevine.ai).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Tools are available">
    Run `/mcp` again and confirm that you see the status is connected and authenticated. The [Grapevine MCP tools](/features/mcp-api) should now be available to your Claude instance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup with API Key
If you don't want to handle interactive authentication (e.g. you're running Claude in a script, or you're develpoing on a remote server without a browser), you can use an API key instead.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an API key">
  Navigate to the [API Keys page](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/api-keys) in the Grapevine admin dashboard and create a new API key. For more information on API keys, see the [authentication guide](/getting-started/authentication).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the MCP server">
  Run the following command to add the Grapevine MCP server with your API key:

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport http grapevine https://mcp.getgrapevine.ai --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```
  Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Tools are available">
    Run `/mcp` in `claude`and confirm that you see the status is connected and authenticated. The [Grapevine MCP tools](/features/mcp-api) should now be available to your Claude instance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Claude will now be able to access Grapevine's tools to search your company's internal context.
