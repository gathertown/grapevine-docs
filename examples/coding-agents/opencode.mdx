description: Setup OpenCode MCP integration with Grapevine
---

This guide shows how to configure OpenCode to use Grapevine for company context.

## Prerequisites

- An OpenCode installation
- A Grapevine account with API access

## Setup

OpenCode [does not yet support Oauth for Remote MCP servers](https://github.com/sst/opencode/issues/988). Therefore, we will use `mcp-remote` as a workaround, so we don't have to hardcode any API credentials.

### 1. Configure MCP server

First, add the MCP server to your OpenCode configuration:

```json opencode.json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "grapevine": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.getgrapevine.ai"]
    },
  },
}

```


### 2. Authentication

Login manually once so that OpenCode picks up your credentials:

```zsh
npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.getgrapevine.ai
```

Your browser will open, login with the same account you use to access your [Grapevine dashboard](https://app.getgrapevine.ai).

### 3. Test the connection

Restart OpenCode and verify the connection by asking a question that requires company context:

```
Use the grapevine mcp. What authentication patterns do we use in our codebase?
```
