description: Setup Cursor MCP integration with Grapevine
---

This guide shows how to configure Cursor to use Grapevine for company context.

## Prerequisites

- Cursor installed
- A Grapevine tenant

## Setup with OAuth (Recommended)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your Cursor MCP configuration">
You can find this in your Cursor settings > Tools & MCP > New MCP server, or by running `open ~/.cursor/mcp.json` in your terminal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Grapevine MCP server">
    Add the following configuration to the file:

```json mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grapevine": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.getgrapevine.ai"
    }
  }
}
```

If you already have other MCP servers configured, add `grapevine` to the existing `mcpServers` object.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login to Grapevine ">
  Your browser will open to authenticate you with Grapevine. Make sure to login using the same account you use to access your [Grapevine dashboard](https://app.getgrapevine.ai).
  </Step>
</Steps>

Cursor's AI agent will now be able to access Grapevine's tools to search your company's internal context.
