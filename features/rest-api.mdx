title: REST Endpoint
description: Quickly query your internal knowledge base using natural language via REST
---

The REST API provides a single HTTP endpoint, used for querying your knowledge base with natural language. This endpoint is a wrapper around the [`ask_agent` tool in our MCP](/features/mcp-api#ask-agent). For advanced use cases and a more comprehensive understanding of our API, see the [MCP API documentation](/features/mcp-api).

<Note>
  Since this endpoint is a wrapper over the MCP `ask_agent` tool, the latency may be high for each request - assume multiple minutes in your application.
</Note>
