Get up and running with Grapevine to search your company's knowledge base.

Before you can build with Grapevine, you'll need to create an account and complete the in-product onboarding so we have data to work with.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Go to [app.getgrapevine.ai](https://app.getgrapevine.ai) and sign up with your work email. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete in-product onboarding">
    We'll ask a few quick questions to help us start to understand your organization, then ask you to setup your first integrations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write company-specific context">
    We recommend writing a short blurb about what your company does, and any key terms or decisions that are important to your organization. For example, if you have a "v1" and "v2" version of your product, this is a great place to call this out.
    This context can be edited at any time, and will be explicitly injected into any [`ask_agent`](/features/mcp-api#ask-agent) calls.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an API key">
    Once you see the API Key section in the sidebar, you can create a new API key. Check out the [authentication guide](/getting-started/authentication) for more details!
  </Step>
