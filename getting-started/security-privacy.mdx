description: Learn how Grapevine protects your data and respects privacy
---

Grapevine is built with security and privacy as core principles. The platform is designed to keep every tenant’s data isolated, resilient against bad actors, and trusted by enterprise teams.

## Security

<Note>
  Grapevine is built from the ground up around security. We maintain SOC 2 Type II certification and partner with an independent security firm for recurring audits and penetration testing.

    TLS 1.3 protects every request in transit, while AES-256 encryption keeps all data at rest secured. Secrets and credentials are isolated inside AWS Secrets Manager.

  <Card title="Tenant isolation by design" icon="users">
    Dedicated compute per tenant group and signed tenant context on every request ensure data is never commingled. Cross-tenant access is structurally impossible.

    Independent experts conduct recurring penetration tests and audits across our infrastructure, validating every control.

## Member roles

Grapevine supports two member roles to control access to administrative functions while maintaining data privacy:

- **Members** can connect to the MCP to query and access data, but cannot access the admin UI
- **Admins** can access both the admin UI and the MCP, with full administrative capabilities

<Note>
  Admins cannot access other members' private data. All users are subject to the same permission-aware access controls that mirror source-level permissions.
</Note>

### Inviting users

You can invite additional users to your Grapevine organization through the [Invitation panel](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/invite).

    Disconnect sources, revoke tokens, or delete data at any time from the admin console—your changes take effect immediately.

## Data deletion

Once you confirm deletion, Grapevine stops indexing new content right away and begins purging all stored data. In most cases the removal finishes within minutes.
