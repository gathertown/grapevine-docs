---

Grapevine supports multiple authentication methods depending on your use case.

## API keys

API keys are the recommended method for programmatic access to Grapevine.

### Creating an API key

1. Navigate to the API Keys page in your admin dashboard
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give your key a descriptive name
4. Copy the key immediately - it won't be shown again

### Using API keys

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.getgrapevine.ai/v1/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is our pricing strategy?"}'
```

## JWT tokens

For user-specific access, Grapevine supports JWT-based authentication.

### Token format

JWT tokens must include:

- `sub` - User identifier
- `org_id` - Organization identifier
- `exp` - Expiration timestamp

### Using JWT tokens

```bash
curl https://api.getgrapevine.ai/v1/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is our pricing strategy?"}'
```

## OAuth (for integrations)

When connecting data sources, Grapevine uses OAuth 2.0 to securely authenticate with third-party services.

The OAuth flow is handled automatically through the admin interface when you connect a new integration.
