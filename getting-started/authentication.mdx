description: Learn how to authenticate with Grapevine's API
---

Grapevine uses API keys for authentication. API keys provide programmatic access to both the REST API and MCP protocol.

## Creating an API key

To create a new API key:

1. Open the [API Keys page](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/api-keys) in the Grapevine admin dashboard
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Integration", "Development")
4. Click **Create**
5. **Copy the key immediately** - it will only be shown once

<Warning>
  API keys are shown only once at creation. Store them securely - you won't be able to see them again.
</Warning>

## Using API keys

API keys work with both Grapevine's [REST API](/features/rest-api) and [MCP API](/features/mcp-api). API keys are currently team-scoped, and only have access to public information in your tenant. For more information on public vs private data, see [Privacy](/getting-started/security-privacy)

### REST API

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl https://api.getgrapevine.ai/v1/ask \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is our pricing strategy?"}'
```

See the [REST API documentation](/features/rest-api) for complete endpoint details.

### MCP Protocol

Grapevine runs as a remote MCP server. Configure your MCP client to connect to:

```
https://mcp.getgrapevine.ai
```

Include your API key in the Authorization header. Example configuration for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grapevine": {
      "url": "https://mcp.getgrapevine.ai",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See the [MCP API documentation](/features/mcp-api) for complete protocol details and available tools.

## Managing API keys

### Viewing keys

You can view all your API keys on the [API Keys page](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/api-keys). The list shows:
- Key name
- Partial key (prefix only)
- Creation date
- Last used date

### Revoking keys

To revoke an API key:

1. Open the [API Keys page](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/api-keys)
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click the **Delete** button

Revoked keys stop working immediately.

## Security best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Store securely" icon="lock">
    Store API keys in environment variables or secure credential management systems. Never commit them to version control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use descriptive names" icon="tag">
    Name keys based on their purpose or environment to make management easier.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate regularly" icon="rotate">
    Keys don't expire - make sure you rotate them if there is ever a chance they are compromised (such as team changes).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limit exposure" icon="eye-slash">
    Only share keys with team members who need them. Create separate keys for different uses.
