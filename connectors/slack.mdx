description: Connect Slack to index messages and channels
---

The Slack connector indexes messages, threads, and channels from your Slack workspace.

## What gets indexed

- Public channel messages
- Private channel messages (if bot is invited)
- Direct messages (if bot is invited)
- Thread replies
- File attachments and links

## Setup

### 1. Create a Slack app

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click "Create New App"
3. Choose "From scratch"
4. Name your app and select your workspace

### 2. Configure permissions

Add these OAuth scopes:

**Bot Token Scopes:**
- `channels:history` - Read public channel messages
- `channels:read` - View basic channel information
- `groups:history` - Read private channel messages
- `groups:read` - View private channels
- `im:history` - Read direct messages
- `im:read` - View direct messages
- `users:read` - View user information

### 3. Install to workspace

Click "Install to Workspace" and authorize the app.

### 4. Connect to Grapevine

1. In Grapevine, go to Integrations
2. Click "Connect" on Slack
3. Enter your Bot User OAuth Token
4. Click "Save"

## Permissions

The Slack connector respects channel permissions:

- Public channels are searchable by all users
- Private channels are only searchable by members
- Direct messages are only searchable by participants

## Webhook setup

For real-time updates, configure webhooks:

1. In your Slack app settings, go to "Event Subscriptions"
2. Enable events
3. Set Request URL to: `https://webhooks.getgrapevine.ai/slack`
4. Subscribe to these bot events:
   - `message.channels`
   - `message.groups`
   - `message.im`

## Limitations

- Messages older than Slack's retention policy cannot be indexed
- Deleted messages are removed from the index
- File content is not indexed, only metadata
