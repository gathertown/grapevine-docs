description: Connect Slack to index messages and enable Q&A
---

The Slack connector indexes messages from your Slack workspace and powers the Grapevine AI bot that answers questions directly in Slack.

## What gets indexed

- Public channel messages
- Direct messages (from historical exports only)

<Note>
  Private messages stay private, and are only searchable by the users who sent or received them.

## Permissions

The Slack bot requires these permissions:

- Read public channel messages and history
- Send messages and replies
- Read user information
- Join public channels
- React to messages

## How the bot works

### Asking questions

The bot responds when:
- Someone mentions the bot with `@BotName`
- Someone sends a direct message to the bot
- Someone replies in a thread where the bot has responded

### Bot configuration

You can configure:
- **Bot name** - Customize the bot's display name
- **Channel access** - Choose whether the bot answers in all channels or only specific ones
- **Excluded channels** - Prevent the bot from responding in certain channels

## Sync behavior

- **Initial sync** - Begins after historical export upload (if provided)
- **Ongoing syncs** - Real-time indexing of new messages via Slack events
- **Deletions** - Deleted messages are removed from the index automatically

## Limitations

- Real-time indexing only captures public channel messages
- Direct messages require historical export upload and are only used as bot context (not searchable)
- File content is not indexed (only metadata)
- The bot does not respond to guest users or external Slack Connect channels
