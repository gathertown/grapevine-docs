description: Connect Gong to index call recordings and transcripts
---

The Gong connector indexes call recordings, transcripts, and permissions from your Gong account.

## What gets indexed

- **Call transcripts** - Full text of call conversations
- **Call metadata** - Participants, duration, date, and time
- **Speaker identification** - Who said what during the call
- **Public folders** - Calls organized in your Gong public library
- **Permission profiles** - User access and visibility settings

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    1. In Grapevine, go to **Integrations** and click on **Gong**
    2. Click **Connect Gong Account**
    3. Log into Gong (if needed) and review the permission request
    4. Click **Authorize** to grant access
    5. You will be redirected back to Grapevine and the initial sync begins automatically
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure webhook (optional)">
    For real-time updates, configure webhooks in Gong:

    1. In Grapevine, copy your Webhook URL from the integration page
    2. In Gong, go to **Admin Center** → **Ecosystem** → **Automation Rules**
    3. Click **Add rule** → **New rule** → **Action** → **Fire Webhook**
    4. Paste your webhook URL: `https://example.ingest.getgrapevine.ai/webhooks/gong`
    5. Select **Signed JWT header** as the authentication method
    6. Click **Show public key** in Gong and copy the entire key
    7. Save the rule
    8. Test the webhook to verify it's working
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The Gong connector respects Gong permissions:

- Users only see calls they have access to in Gong
- Permission profiles are respected
- Private calls remain private

## Sync behavior

<Note>
  Permissions and calls are synchronized hourly to ensure your Grapevine index stays up to date with changes in Gong.
</Note>

- **Initial sync** - Begins automatically after authorization
- **Ongoing syncs** - Runs every hour to capture new calls and permission changes
- **Deletions** - Deleted calls are removed from the index during the next sync
- **Real-time updates** - Available via webhook configuration (see setup above)
