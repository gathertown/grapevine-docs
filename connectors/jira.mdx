  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The Jira connector respects Jira permissions:

- Only issues the Forge app can access are indexed
- Project-level permissions are preserved
- Restricted issues are handled according to Jira access controls

## Sync behavior

<Note>
  The initial indexing processes issues by project. Real-time updates are configured automatically via the Forge app.
</Note>

- **Initial sync** - Begins automatically after installation
- **Ongoing syncs** - Real-time updates via Forge app webhooks keep your index current
- **Deletions** - Deleted issues are removed from the index automatically

## Limitations

- Only Jira Cloud is supported (not Data Center or Server)
- Archived projects are not indexed
- Some custom field types may have limited support
