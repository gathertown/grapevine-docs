## Permissions

The Google Drive connector uses domain-wide delegation to access files:

- Only files with domain-wide read access are indexed
- Files must be accessible to your entire workspace domain
- Private files (visible only to specific users) are excluded
- Files shared only with specific people/groups are excluded

## Sync behavior

<Note>
  The initial indexing process may take time depending on the size of your Google Workspace. Real-time updates are configured automatically.
</Note>

- **Initial sync** - Begins automatically after setup completion
- **Ongoing syncs** - Real-time updates keep your index current with changes
- **Deletions** - Deleted files are removed from the index automatically

## Limitations

- Only files with domain-wide read access are indexed
- Files owned by suspended user accounts are not indexed
- Folders are not indexed as separate entities
- Trashed files are automatically excluded from indexing
