description: Connect Attio to index companies, people, and deals from your CRM
---

The Attio connector indexes CRM data including companies, people, and deals from your Attio workspace.

## What gets indexed

- Companies (name, domains, description, categories, estimated ARR, location)
- People (name, email, phone, job title, company associations, location)
- Deals (name, value, pipeline stage, expected close date, owner, associated companies and people)
- Notes and tasks (embedded within deal records)

## Setup

<Note>
  You must be a **workspace admin** in Attio to authorize the Grapevine integration.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable required objects in Attio">
    Before connecting, ensure the objects you want to index are enabled in your Attio workspace:

    1. In Attio, go to **Workspace settings** > **Data** > **Objects**
    2. Enable the objects you want Grapevine to index (Companies, People, Deals)

    <Warning>
      **Important:** On Attio's Free plan, only Companies and People are enabled by default. Deals must be explicitly enabled by a workspace admin. If Deals is not enabled, the connector will skip indexing deals and continue with other available objects.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    1. In Grapevine, go to [**Integrations**](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations) and click on **Attio**
    2. Click **Connect Attio Account**
    3. You'll be redirected to Attio for authorization
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize the app">
    1. Log into Attio (if needed)
    2. Review the requested permissions
    3. Click **Allow** to authorize
    4. You'll be redirected back to Grapevine
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indexing begins">
    Grapevine will automatically begin indexing your Attio data. The initial sync may take time depending on the amount of data in your workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The Attio connector requests the following OAuth scopes:

| Scope | Access | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| User Management | Read | View workspace members for attribution |
| Records | Read | Access companies, people, and deals |
| Object Configuration | Read | Read object schemas and attributes |
| List Entries | Read | Access list entries and pipeline data |
| List Configuration | Read | Read list and pipeline configurations |
| Comments | Read | Access comments and threads on records |
| Notes | Read | Read notes attached to records |
| Tasks | Read | Read tasks linked to records |
| Meetings | Read | Access meeting records |
| Call Recordings | Read | Access call recordings and transcripts |
| Webhooks | Read-write | Register webhooks for real-time updates |

<Info>
  Some scopes like Webhooks and Call Recordings are requested to support future features such as real-time sync and meeting transcript indexing. Grapevine only requests read access where possible and never modifies your Attio data.
</Info>

## Sync behavior

- **Initial sync** - Indexes all available records from enabled objects
- **Incremental updates** - New and updated records are synced periodically
- **Deletions** - Deleted records are removed from the index automatically

## Object availability by plan

Attio has different object availability based on your subscription plan:

| Plan | Available Objects |
|------|------------------|
| Free | Companies, People + 1 additional (Deals, Users, or Workspaces) |
| Plus | Companies, People + 3 additional (Deals, Users, Workspaces) |
| Pro  | Up to 12 standard objects + custom objects |

<Info>
  If an object is not enabled in your Attio workspace, Grapevine will gracefully skip it and continue indexing the objects that are available.
</Info>

## Limitations

- Custom objects are not currently indexed
- Only records from enabled standard objects are indexed
- Notes and tasks are embedded within deal documents rather than indexed separately
