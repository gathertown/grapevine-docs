description: Connect Zendesk to index tickets and comments
---

## What gets indexed

- **Tickets** - All ticket fields including custom fields
- **Ticket metrics** - All ticket metrics, ex. reply time, wait time, reopens.
- **Ticket people** - Brand, Group, Assignee, Requester, Submitter, Followers, Contributors
- **Ticket comments** - All comments for each ticket

## Setup

<Note>
  You must be an **Admin** in Zendesk to properly authorize the Grapevine app.
  We use admin-only API's for incremental data syncing.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    In Grapevine, go to the [Zendesk
    Integration](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations/zendesk)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Grapevine">
    Click **Connect** and log into Zendesk (if needed), review the permission
    request and authorize. You will be redirected back to Grapevine and your
    data will begin syncing immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The Zendesk connector makes all synced tickets visible in Grapevine.

## Sync behavior

- **Initial full sync** - Begins automatically after authorization, progresses backwards in time so latest data should be available quickly.
- **Ongoing syncs** - Runs every hour to capture incremental ticket updates

## Limitations

- Admin access is required to connect and sync data.
- Ticket updates follow the sync schedule, so changes in Zendesk may not appear in Grapevine immediately.
- Zendesk permission models are not applied in Grapevine.
  - This is intentional so that helpdesk information can be broadly searchable rather than restricted to Zendesk Agent roles. If this is a concern for your workflow or data policies, please reach out.
  - As a result, users may see citation links to Zendesk tickets they would not normally have access to within Zendesk.
