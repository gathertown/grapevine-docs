description: Connect Zendesk to index tickets and comments
---

## What gets indexed

- **Tickets** - All ticket fields including custom fields
- **Ticket metrics** - All ticket metrics, ex. reply time, wait time, reopens.
- **Ticket people** - Brand, Group, Assignee, Requester, Submitter, Followers, Contributors
- **Ticket comments** - All comments for each ticket

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be a Zendesk Admin">
    We use admin-only API's for incremental data syncing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    In Grapevine, go to the [**Zendesk
    Integration**](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations/zendesk)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Grapevine">
    Click **Connect** and log into Zendesk (if needed), review the permission
    request and authorize. You will be redirected back to Grapevine and your
    data will begin syncing immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The Zendesk connector makes all synced tickets visible in Grapevine.

## Sync behavior

- **Initial full sync** - Begins automatically after authorization, progresses backwards in time so latest data should be available quickly.
- **Ongoing syncs** - Runs every hour to capture incremental ticket updates

## Limitations

- Zendesk permissions are not respected so a user may see a result in Grapevine they do not have access to view on Zendesk.
