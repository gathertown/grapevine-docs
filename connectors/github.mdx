## Permissions

GitHub permissions are preserved:

- Public repositories are searchable by all users
- Private repositories are only searchable by users with access
- Organization members see organization repositories

## Webhook events

Grapevine listens for these events:

- `push` - Code changes
- `pull_request` - PR created/updated
- `issues` - Issue created/updated
- `issue_comment` - Comments added
- `pull_request_review` - PR reviews

## File type support

Indexed file types:

- Source code (`.js`, `.py`, `.go`, `.java`, etc.)
- Markdown (`.md`)
- Documentation (`.txt`, `.rst`)
- Configuration (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`)

## Limitations

- Binary files are not indexed
- Files larger than 1MB are truncated
- Maximum 10,000 files per repository
- Archived repositories are not indexed
