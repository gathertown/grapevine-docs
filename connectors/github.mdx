description: Connect GitHub to index repositories, pull requests, and files
---

The GitHub connector indexes pull requests, code files, and comments from your GitHub repositories.

## What gets indexed

- Pull requests
- Pull request comments and reviews
- Code files
- Repository metadata

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    1. In Grapevine, go to [**Integrations**](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations) and click on **GitHub**
    2. Click **Install GitHub App**
    3. A popup window will open to GitHub
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install GitHub App">
    1. Select the organization or account where you want to install the app
    2. Choose which repositories to grant access to:
       - **All repositories** - Indexes all current and future repositories
       - **Only select repositories** - Choose specific repositories to index
    3. Click **Install** to authorize the app
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indexing begins">
    You'll be redirected back to Grapevine and the installation will be saved automatically. Grapevine will begin indexing your GitHub repositories, pull requests, and files. The initial sync may take time depending on the size and number of repositories.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The GitHub connector respects GitHub permissions:

- Only repositories granted to the GitHub App installation are indexed
- Private repository access is controlled by GitHub App permissions
- Users can modify repository access at any time through GitHub settings

## Sync behavior

<Note>
  The initial indexing processes repositories in batches. Real-time updates are configured automatically via webhooks.
</Note>

- **Initial sync** - Begins automatically after installation
- **Ongoing syncs** - Real-time updates via GitHub webhooks keep your index current
- **Deletions** - Deleted files and closed PRs are reflected in the index automatically

## Limitations

- Files larger than 1MB are truncated
- Binary files are not indexed (only source code and text files)
- Only repositories granted to the GitHub App installation are indexed
