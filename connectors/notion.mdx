description: Connect Notion to index pages and databases
---

The Notion connector indexes pages, databases, and their content from your Notion workspace.

## What gets indexed

- Pages and sub-pages
- Database entries
- Page content (text, headings, lists, code blocks)
- Page properties
- File metadata

<Note>
  Only pages explicitly shared with the integration are indexed. You must manually share each workspace or page you want to index.
</Note>

## Setup

  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">

    2. Select your workspace
    3. Set capabilities to **Read content** only
    4. Click **Submit**
    5. Copy the **Internal Integration Token** (starts with `ntn_`)

    2. Click **Share** in the top right
    3. Search for your integration name and invite it
    4. Grant **Read** access

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure webhook">
    1. In Grapevine, copy the webhook URL displayed
    2. Return to your Notion integration settings
    3. Under **Webhooks**, click **Add webhook subscription**
    4. Paste the webhook URL from Grapevine

    6. Copy the **verification token** and paste it in Grapevine
    7. Click **Verify** in Notion
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indexing begins">
    Grapevine will automatically begin indexing your Notion pages. The initial sync may take time depending on the number of pages in your workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The Notion connector respects Notion's sharing permissions:

- Only pages explicitly shared with the integration are indexed
- Child pages within shared pages are automatically included

## Sync behavior

<Note>
  The initial indexing processes pages in batches with delays to respect Notion's rate limits.
</Note>

- **Initial sync** - Begins automatically after setup completion
- **Ongoing syncs** - Real-time updates via webhooks keep your index current
- **Deletions** - Deleted pages are removed from the index automatically

## Limitations

- Only pages shared with the integration are indexed
- Comments are not indexed
- Embedded content from external sources is not indexed
- File and image content is not indexed (only metadata and captions)
- Tables are partially supported
