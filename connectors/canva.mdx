description: Connect Canva to index design metadata
---

The Canva connector indexes metadata about your Canva designs, making them searchable by title, owner, and other attributes.

## What gets indexed

- **Design titles** - Names of your Canva designs
- **Design metadata** - Page count, creation date, last modified date
- **Owner information** - User ID and team ID of the design owner
- **URLs** - Edit and view URLs for quick access to designs

<Warning>
  **Design content is not indexed.** Due to Canva Connect API limitations, only design metadata (titles, dates, owners) is indexed. The actual visual content, text, and images within designs are not searchable through Grapevine.
</Warning>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    1. In Grapevine, go to [**Integrations**](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations) and click on **Canva**
    2. Click **Connect Canva Account** to begin the authorization process
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize connection">
    1. You'll be redirected to Canva to authorize the Grapevine integration
    2. Log into Canva if needed
    3. Review the requested permissions
    4. Click **Allow** to grant access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indexing begins">
    You'll be redirected back to Grapevine and the connection will be saved automatically. Grapevine will begin indexing your Canva design metadata.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Required scopes

The Canva connector requests the following OAuth scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `asset:read` | Read access to assets |
| `design:content:read` | Read access to design content |
| `design:meta:read` | Read access to design metadata (title, dates, owner) |
| `folder:read` | Read access to folders |
| `profile:read` | Read user profile (display name) |

## Permissions

- All indexed Canva design metadata is visible to all users in the Grapevine tenant
- Admin permissions required for initial setup

## Sync behavior

- **Initial sync** - Indexes metadata for all accessible designs
- **Ongoing syncs** - Runs periodically to capture new and updated designs
- **Deletions** - Deleted designs are removed from the index

## Rate limits

Canva enforces per-endpoint rate limits:

| Endpoint | Rate Limit |
|----------|------------|
| List designs | 100 req/min/user |
| Get design | 100 req/min/user |
| List folder items | 100 req/min/user |

<Note>
  The connector implements automatic retry with exponential backoff when rate limits are encountered.
</Note>

## Limitations

- **Content not indexed** - Only design metadata is searchable, not the visual content within designs
- Designs shared with you are indexed, but visibility depends on your Canva permissions
- Access tokens expire after ~4 hours and are automatically refreshed
