description: Connect Gmail to index emails and threads
---

The Gmail connector indexes emails and threads from Google Workspace accounts using service account authentication with domain-wide delegation. Personal Gmail accounts are not supported.

## What gets indexed

- Email subjects and bodies
- Email threads
- Sender and recipient information
- Labels
- Email metadata

<Note>
  Emails remain private and are only searchable by the users who sent or received them.

## Permissions

The Gmail connector uses domain-wide delegation to access emails:

- Service account impersonates each user to access their emails
- Only works with Google Workspace accounts (not personal Gmail)
- Requires Google Workspace admin privileges to configure

## Sync behavior

<Note>
  The initial indexing process may take time depending on the size of your organization. Real-time updates are configured automatically via Gmail push notifications.
</Note>

- **Initial sync** - Begins automatically after setup completion
- **Ongoing syncs** - Real-time updates via Gmail push notifications keep your index current
- **Webhook refresh** - Notification channels refresh automatically every 7 days

## Limitations

- Only emails from the last 90 days are indexed
- Only Inbox and Sent folders are indexed
- Only Google Workspace accounts are supported (personal Gmail accounts are not supported)
