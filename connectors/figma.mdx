description: Connect Figma to index design files and comments
---

The Figma connector indexes design files, FigJam boards, and comments from your Figma workspace.

## What gets indexed

- **Design files** - File names, page names, and document structure
- **Components** - Component names and descriptions
- **Text content** - All text elements within designs
- **Comments** - Comment threads, replies, and resolution status
- **FigJam boards** - Same content types as design files

<Note>
  Both Figma design files and FigJam boards are indexed. The connector extracts text content directly from TEXT nodes in your designs, making your copy searchable.
</Note>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    1. In Grapevine, go to [**Integrations**](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations) and click on **Figma**
    2. Click **Connect Figma Account** to begin the authorization process
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize connection">
    1. You'll be redirected to Figma to authorize the Grapevine integration
    2. Log into Figma if needed
    3. Review the requested permissions
    4. Click **Allow access** to grant access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select teams">
    1. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to Grapevine
    2. Select which Figma teams you want to index
    3. Click **Save** to confirm your selection
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indexing begins">
    Grapevine will begin indexing files from your selected teams. The initial sync may take time depending on the number of files and their complexity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

- All indexed Figma content is visible to all users in the Grapevine tenant
- Admin permissions required for initial setup

## Sync behavior

<Warning>
  **Real-time updates require a paid Figma plan.** Webhooks are only available on Figma Professional, Organization, or Enterprise plans. If your team is on a Starter or Free plan, updates will only sync during periodic backfills.
</Warning>

- **Initial sync** - Indexes all files from selected teams
- **Real-time updates** - Via webhooks for file updates, deletions, and new comments (paid plans only)
- **Periodic sync** - Runs periodically to catch any missed updates and sync teams without webhook support
- **Deletions** - Deleted files are removed from the index automatically

## Rate limits

Figma enforces API rate limits that vary based on your **seat type** and plan. The user who connects Figma to Grapevine must have a **Dev or Full seat** for acceptable performance.

<Warning>
  **Use a Dev or Full seat to connect.** View and Collab seats have severely restricted rate limits (as low as 6 requests per month), which will prevent Grapevine from syncing your files effectively.
</Warning>

### Dev/Full seat rate limits

| Tier | Starter | Professional | Organization | Enterprise |
|------|---------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Tier 1 | 10/min | 15/min | 20/min | 20/min |
| Tier 2 | 25/min | 50/min | 100/min | 100/min |
| Tier 3 | 50/min | 100/min | 150/min | 150/min |

### View/Collab seat rate limits (not recommended)

| Tier | Starter | Professional | Organization | Enterprise |
|------|---------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Tier 1 | 6/month | 6/month | 6/month | 6/month |
| Tier 2 | 5/min | 5/min | 5/min | 5/min |
| Tier 3 | 10/min | 10/min | 10/min | 10/min |

<Note>
  For the best experience, ensure the user connecting Figma has a **Dev or Full seat** on a **Professional or higher plan**. This provides both real-time webhooks and adequate API rate limits for syncing.
</Note>

For more details, see [Figma's rate limit documentation](https://developers.figma.com/docs/rest-api/rate-limits/).

## Limitations

- Real-time webhooks require Figma Professional plan or higher (Starter/Free plans use periodic sync only)
- Rate limits may slow initial sync for large workspaces
- File attachments and embedded images are not indexed (only text and metadata)
- Only files from selected teams are indexed
