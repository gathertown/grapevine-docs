description: Connect Fireflies to index meeting transcripts

## What gets indexed

- **Transcripts** - Full transcript (sentences), AI summary notes, participants and metadata

## Setup

<Note>
  It is recommended to be a **Super Admin** in Fireflies to properly authorize
  the Grapevine app. If this is unavailable to you then only transcripts
  available to the provided API key will be ingested.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    In Grapevine, go to the [Fireflies
    Integration](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations/fireflies)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Super Admin">
    In Fireflies create a full permission [super
    admin](https://guide.fireflies.ai/articles/7734409426-learn-about-the-super-admin-role).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Super Admin">
    In Fireflies get your [API
    key](https://app.fireflies.ai/settings#DeveloperSettings), preferably from a
    super admin.
  </Step>

    Paste the API key into the [Grapevine Fireflies
    Integration](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations/fireflies) and click
    connect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The fireflies connector makes ingested meeting transcripts _only_ visible to the organizer and
participants. This access is granted via email addresses that were invited to the meeting. This has
implications on transcripts from "live meetings" and uploaded transcripts. These will likely only
be visibile to the organizer. Please contact us if you are interested in a more permissive model
for fireflies transcript visibility.

## Sync behavior

- **Initial full sync** - Begins automatically after authorization, progresses backwards in time so latest data should be available quickly.
- **Ongoing syncs** - Runs every hour to capture new transcripts

## Limitations

- A super admin is highly recommended to connect and sync data.
- Transcript ingestion follows the sync schedule, so new transcripts may not appear in Grapevine immediately.
