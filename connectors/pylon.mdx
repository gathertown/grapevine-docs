The Pylon connector syncs your customer support issues from [Pylon](https://usepylon.com) into Grapevine, making them searchable alongside your other company knowledge.

## What gets indexed

- **Issues** - Support tickets and conversations including title, description, status, priority, and tags
- **Issue metadata** - Assignee, requester, account, team, and custom fields
- **Metrics** - First response time, resolution time, and CSAT scores
- **Linked issues** - References to external issues in Linear, Asana, Jira, or GitHub
