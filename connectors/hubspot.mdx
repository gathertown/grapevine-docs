- Companies
- Deals
- Tickets
- Deal activities (emails, meetings, calls, notes, tasks)

  You must be a **Super Admin** in HubSpot to install and authorize the Grapevine app.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    1. In Grapevine, go to [**Integrations**](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations) and click on **HubSpot**
    2. Click **Connect HubSpot Account**
    3. You'll be redirected to HubSpot for authorization
  </Step>

    4. You'll be redirected back to Grapevine
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indexing begins">
    Grapevine will automatically begin indexing your HubSpot data. The initial sync indexes the last 3 years of data and may take time depending on the amount of data in your account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The HubSpot connector requires read access to:

- Contacts
- Companies
- Deals
- Tickets
- Email and communication activities

## Sync behavior

<Note>
  The connector uses dual sync: real-time webhooks for immediate updates and a periodic sync every 20 minutes as a safety net.
</Note>

- **Initial sync** - Indexes the last 3 years of data
- **Real-time updates** - Webhooks provide immediate updates for changes
- **Periodic sync** - Runs every 20 minutes to catch any missed updates
- **Deletions** - Deleted records are removed from the index automatically

## Limitations

- Initial backfill limited to last 3 years of data
- All deals, contacts, companies, and tickets are indexed (no selective filtering)
