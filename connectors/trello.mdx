description: Connect Trello to index boards, lists, and cards
---

The Trello connector indexes cards and their content from your Trello boards.

## What gets indexed

- Cards (titles, descriptions, comments, checklists, attachments)
- Card metadata (board name, list name, labels, assigned members, due dates)

<Note>
  Private boards stay private, and are only searchable by users who have access to them. Boards and lists are not independently searchable—they appear as metadata on cards.
</Note>

## Setup

<Warning>
  **Use a dedicated service account.** The Trello connection is tied to the authorizing user's account. If that user is removed from your Trello organization or their account is deleted, webhooks will stop working and syncing will break. To avoid disruption, connect using a dedicated service account that won't be removed.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    1. In Grapevine, go to [**Integrations**](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations) and click on **Trello**
    2. Click **Connect Trello Account** to begin the authorization process
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Grapevine Power-Up">
    1. You'll be redirected to Trello to authorize the Grapevine Power-Up
    2. Review the requested permissions
    3. Click **Allow** to grant access

    <Note>
      You need admin permissions on your Trello workspace to install the Power-Up.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize connection">
    1. Complete the OAuth 1.0 authentication handshake
    2. The Grapevine Power-Up will be installed as a headless Power-Up
    3. Authorization will apply to all boards accessible to your account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indexing begins">
    Grapevine will automatically begin indexing your Trello boards and cards. The initial sync may take time depending on the number of boards and cards in your workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The Trello connector respects Trello permissions:

- All boards accessible to the authorized account are indexed
- Private boards remain private and are only searchable by authorized users
- Board-level permissions are preserved in search results
- Admin permissions required for initial setup and to index private boards

<Note>
  Admin privileges are required to receive webhook events from private boards. If the authorized account loses admin status in an organization, private boards in that organization will no longer sync.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **What happens if the authorizing user is removed:**
  - **User removed from organization** — Webhooks are deleted and real-time syncing stops. Previously indexed content remains but becomes stale.
  - **User account deleted** — The connection breaks entirely. You'll need to reconnect with a different account.
  - **User loses admin privileges** — Private boards stop syncing, but public boards continue to work.

  To restore syncing, disconnect the integration in Grapevine and reconnect with an active admin account.
</Warning>

## Sync behavior

<Note>
  The initial indexing processes all accessible boards and cards. For large workspaces (100+ boards), rate limiting is applied and the sync may take several hours. Real-time updates are configured automatically via webhooks.
</Note>

- **Initial sync** - Begins automatically after authorization
- **Ongoing syncs** - Real-time updates via webhooks keep your index current
- **Deletions** - Deleted cards and boards are removed from the index automatically

## Limitations

- Card attachment metadata is indexed, but file contents are not processed
- Archived boards and cards are not indexed
- Admin permissions required to index private boards
