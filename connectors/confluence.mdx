The Confluence connector indexes pages, spaces, and comments from your Atlassian Confluence instance.

- Pages and child pages
- Page comments

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

The Confluence connector respects Confluence permissions:

- Only pages the Forge app can access are indexed
- Space-level permissions are preserved
- Restricted pages are handled according to Confluence access controls

## Sync behavior

<Note>
  The initial indexing processes pages by space. Real-time updates are configured automatically via the Forge app.
</Note>

- **Initial sync** - Begins automatically after installation
- **Ongoing syncs** - Real-time updates via Forge app webhooks keep your index current
- **Deletions** - Deleted pages are removed from the index automatically

## Limitations

- Only Confluence Cloud is supported (not Data Center or Server)
- Maximum page size: 10MB
- Archived spaces are not indexed
- Some macros may not be fully indexed
