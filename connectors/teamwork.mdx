description: Connect Teamwork to index tasks and comments
---

The Teamwork connector indexes tasks and their associated comments from your Teamwork projects.

## What gets indexed

- **Tasks** - Task names, descriptions, and full metadata
- **Comments** - Task comments embedded within their parent tasks
- **Task metadata** - Project, task list, status, priority, assignee, creator, due dates, tags, and more

### Task details indexed

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Assignee | User assigned to the task |
| Attachments | Attachment names (content not indexed) |
| Completion status | Whether the task is completed and when |
| Creator | User who created the task |
| Description | Full task description |
| Due date | Task deadline |
| Estimated time | Time estimate in hours/minutes |
| Parent task | For subtasks, the parent task reference |
| Priority | Task priority level |
| Project | Project the task belongs to |
| Start date | Task start date |
| Status | Current task status |
| Tags | Task tags/labels |
| Task list | Task list within the project |

<Note>
  Comments are indexed as part of their parent task, not as separate documents. This keeps task discussions together for better search relevance.
</Note>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    1. In Grapevine, go to [**Integrations**](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations) and click on **Teamwork**
    2. Click **Connect Teamwork Account** to begin the authorization process
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize connection">
    1. You'll be redirected to Teamwork to authorize the Grapevine integration
    2. Log into Teamwork if needed
    3. Select your Teamwork installation
    4. Click **Allow** to grant access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indexing begins">
    You'll be redirected back to Grapevine and the connection will be saved automatically. Grapevine will begin indexing your Teamwork tasks and comments.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

- Only non-private tasks are indexed (private tasks are excluded)
- All indexed Teamwork tasks are visible to all users in the Grapevine tenant

## Sync behavior

- **Initial sync** - Indexes all tasks across all projects, including completed tasks
- **Ongoing syncs** - Uses incremental sync to fetch only tasks updated since the last sync
- **Deletions** - Deleted tasks are removed from the index

<Note>
  The connector uses batch fetching to efficiently retrieve tasks with their related data (projects, task lists, comments, tags, attachments) in fewer API calls.
</Note>

## Rate limits

Teamwork enforces rate limits based on your plan:

| Plan | Rate Limit |
|------|------------|
| Free | 30 req/min |
| Premium+ | 150 req/min |

<Note>
  For large workspaces with many tasks, a Premium or higher plan is recommended for faster initial syncs. The connector implements automatic retry with exponential backoff when rate limits are encountered.
</Note>

## Limitations

- Private tasks are not indexed (only non-private tasks)
- Attachment content is not indexed (only attachment names)
- Task files and documents are not indexed
- Access tokens are long-lived and do not expire
