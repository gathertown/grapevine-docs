description: Connect Asana to index tasks and comments
---

## What gets indexed

- **Tasks** - Most task fields including custom fields
- **Task comments** - All comments on each task
- **Subtasks** - Same as Tasks

## Setup

<Note>
  You must be a **Super Admin** in Asana to properly authorize the Grapevine
  app. The preferred way to authorize is via Service Account. If you do not have
  access to a service account an administrator can OAuth.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Grapevine">
    In Grapevine, go to the [Asana
    Integration](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations/asana)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Service Account">
    In Asana create a full permission [service
    account](https://app.asana.com/admin/0/apps/serviceaccounts). And record the
    generated token. [Learn more about service
    accounts](https://help.asana.com/s/article/service-accounts).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate Grapevine">
    Paste the service account token into the [Grapevine Asana
    Integration](https://app.getgrapevine.ai/integrations/asana) and click
    connect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

<Note>
  Grapevine requests full access because some APIs (specifically the memberships
  API) are not resource scoped. Grapevine only reads data via workspace,
  project, task, subtask, story, membership and team endpoints.
</Note>

The Asana connector makes all synced tasks visible to people who can see them in Asana.

## Sync behavior

- **Initial full sync** - Begins automatically after authorization, progresses backwards in time so latest data should be available quickly.
- **Ongoing syncs** - Runs every 10 minutes to capture incremental task updates

## Limitations

- A service account is highly recommended to connect and sync data.
- Public projects are widely available in Grapevine **but** tasks that have been made "public" will not be widely available in Grapevine due to Asana API limitations.
- Task updates follow the sync schedule, so changes in Asana may not appear in Grapevine immediately.
